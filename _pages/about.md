# About me
I'm Baichuan Zhou, a senior undergraduate at Beihang University. Currently, I am a research intern at [State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/info/1035/1862.htm), advised by [Prof. Lei Huang](https://huangleibuaa.github.io/). My research interests are generally in Computer Vision, Multimodal Language Models and Embodied AI. 

To elaborate, I'm interested in: 

    1. Interpreting how LLM/MLLMs encode their representations through transformers. (Interpretation) 

    2. Building generalist vision-language systems that are capable of handling a variety of computer vision/multimodal tasks. (Application)

    3. Exploring efficient ways to align different modalities. (Alignment)

    4. Improving the robustness and safety of Foundation Models. (Trustworthy) 

    
My short term goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence, and my long term goal is to explore ways to help reach Artificial General Intelligence.
